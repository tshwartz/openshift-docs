= About services

A Kubernetes _service_ is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of pods as a network service. Services allow your applications to receive traffic. Services can be exposed in different ways by specifying a `spec.type` in the `Service` object:

ClusterIP:: Exposes the service on an internal IP address within the cluster. `ClusterIP` is the default service `type`.

NodePort:: Exposes the service on the same port of each selected node in the cluster. `NodePort` makes a service accessible from outside the cluster.

LoadBalancer:: Creates an external load balancer in the current cloud (if supported) and assigns a fixed, external IP address to the service.

== Dual-stack support

If IPv4 and IPv6 dual-stack networking is enabled for your cluster, you can create a service that uses IPv4, IPv6, or both, by defining the `spec.ipFamilyPolicy` and the `spec.ipFamilies` fields in the `Service` object.

The `spec.ipFamilyPolicy` field can be set to one of the following values:

SingleStack:: The control plane assigns a cluster IP address for the service based on the first configured service cluster IP range.

PreferDualStack:: The control plane assigns both IPv4 and IPv6 cluster IP addresses for the service on clusters that have dual-stack configured.

RequireDualStack:: This option fails for clusters that do not have dual-stack networking enabled. For clusters that have dual-stack configured, the behavior is the same as when the value is set to `PreferDualStack`. The control plane allocates cluster IP addresses from both IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges.

You can define which IP family to use for single-stack or define the order of IP families for dual-stack by setting the `spec.ipFamilies` field to one of the following array values:

* `[IPv4]`
* `[IPv6]`
* `[IPv4, IPv6]`
* `[IPv6, IPv4]`
