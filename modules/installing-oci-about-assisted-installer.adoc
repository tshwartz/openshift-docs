= About the {ai-full} and {oci} integration

You can run cluster workloads on {oci-first} infrastructure that supports dedicated, hybrid, public, and multiple cloud environments. Both Red{nbsp}Hat and Oracle test, validate, and support running {oci} in an {product-title} cluster on {oci}.

The {product-title} {ai-full} is a tool designed to automate the installation and management of {product-title} on the {hybrid-console}. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/[Installing {product-title} with the {ai-full}].

{oci-first-no-rt} is a comprehensive cloud computing platform offered by Oracle, providing services that can meet your needs for regulatory compliance, performance, and cost-effectiveness. For more information, see the link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/GSG/Concepts/baremetalintro.html[Oracle Cloud documentation].

//Feel free to enhance 

You can use the {ai-full} to install an {product-title} cluster on the {oci} platform, deploying cloud-native components such as {oci-ccm-full} and {oci-csi-full}, and integrating your cluster with {oci} API resources such as instance node, load balancer, and storage.

.Deployment platforms

The integration between OCP and {oci} is certified on both virtual machines (BMs) and bare metal (BM) machines. Bare metal installations using iSCSI boot drives require a secondary vNIC. 

Oracle provides the secondary vNICs via custom manifests. There are two separate custom manifests for bare metal nodes, one for compute nodes and one for control plane nodes.

Alternatively (taken from Adrien's presentation):
The integration between OCP and {oci} is certified on both virtual machines (BMs) and bare metal (BM) machines. In OCI, bare metal machines are diskless, and use iSCSI for their boot volume. iSCSI is a way of providing a block device over the network. In order to boot, the machines rely on iPXE, from where it gets the network settings and also the settings for accessing the storage.

.Performance considerations

To ensure the best performance conditions for your cluster workloads that operate on {oci}, ensure that volume performance units (VPUs) for your block volume are sized for your workloads. The following list provides guidance for selecting the VPUs needed for specific performance needs:

* Test or proof of concept environment: 100 GB, and 20 to 30 VPUs.
* Basic environment: 500 GB, and 60 VPUs.
* Heavy production environment: More than 500 GB, and 100 or more VPUs.

Consider reserving additional VPUs to provide sufficient capacity for updates and scaling activities. For more information about VPUs, see Volume Performance Units (Oracle documentation).

.Procedure summary 

The procedure for using the {ai-full} in a connected environment to install a cluster on {oci} is illustrated in the diagram below. 

image::684_OpenShift_Installing_on_OCI_0724_assisted.png[Image of a high-level workflow for using the Assisted Installer in a connected environment to install a cluster on {oci}]

An outline of the procedure is as follows:

. In the {oci-first-no-rt} console, create a stack template for the {oci} resources and save it locally as a ZIP file:

.. TBD

.. TBD

. In the {ai-full} console, set up a cluster:

.. Create the cluster.

.. Generate and download the discovery ISO image.

. In the {oci} console, create the infrastructure:

.. Upload the discovery ISO image to the {oci} console.

.. Create a new bucket or use a default bucket provided by {oci}.

.. Upload the discovery ISO image to the bucket.

.. Upload the stack file stored locally and use it to create the stack.

.. Update the manifests with the secret.

. In the {ai-full} console, complete the cluster installation:

.. Set roles for the cluster nodes.

.. Upload the manifests provided by Oracle.

.. Install the cluster.

Previous version - commented out for now

You can run cluster workloads on {oci-first} infrastructure that supports dedicated, hybrid, public, and multiple cloud environments. Both Red{nbsp}Hat and Oracle test, validate, and support running {oci} in an {product-title} cluster on {oci}.

The {ai-full} supports the {oci} platform, and you can use the {ai-full} to access an intuitive interactive workflow for the purposes of automating cluster installation tasks on {oci}.

{oci} provides services that can meet your needs for regulatory compliance, performance, and cost-effectiveness. You can access {oci} Resource Manager configurations to provision and configure {oci} resources.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for provisioning {oci} resources are provided as an example only. You can also choose to create the required resources through other methods; the scripts are just an example. Installing a cluster with infrastructure that you provide requires knowledge of the cloud provider and the installation process on {product-title}. You can access {oci} Resource Manager configurations to complete these steps, or use the configurations to model your own custom script.
====

Follow the steps in the _Installing a cluster on {oci-first-no-rt} by using the Assisted Installer_ document to understand how to use the {ai-full} to install a {product-title} cluster on {oci}. This document demonstrates the use of the {oci} Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) and Oracleâ€™s Container Storage Interface (CSI) objects to link your {product-title} cluster with the {oci} API.
