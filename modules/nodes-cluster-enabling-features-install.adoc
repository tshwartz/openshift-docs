= Enabling feature sets at installation

You can enable feature sets for all nodes in the cluster by editing the `install-config.yaml` file before you deploy the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have an `install-config.yaml` file.

.Procedure

. Use the `featureSet` parameter to specify the name of the feature set you want to enable, such as `TechPreviewNoUpgrade`:
+
.Sample `install-config.yaml` file with an enabled feature set

[source,yaml]
----
compute:
- hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: worker
  platform:
    aws:
      rootVolume:
        iops: 2000
        size: 500
        type: io1
      metadataService:
        authentication: Optional
      type: c5.4xlarge
      zones:
      - us-west-2c
  replicas: 3
featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade
----

. Save the file and reference it when using the installation program to deploy the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. These feature sets are not recommended on production clusters.
====

.Verification

You can verify that the feature gates are enabled by looking at the `kubelet.conf` file on a node after the cluster is installed.

. Start a debug session for a node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
----

. Change your root directory to the host:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# chroot /host
----

. View the `kubelet.conf` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# cat /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
----
+
.Sample output
+
[source,terminal]
----
 ...
featureGates:
  TechPreviewNoUpgrade: true,
  LegacyNodeRoleBehavior: false
 ...
----
+
The features that are listed as `true` are enabled on your cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The features listed vary depending upon the {product-title} version.
