= Creating {oci} resources and services

Create {oci-first} resources and services so that you can establish infrastructure with governance standards that meets your organization's requirements.

From the {oci} web console, you must create the following resources:

* A compartment for better organizing, restricting access, and setting usage limits to {oci} resources.
* An object storage bucket for safely and securely storing the discovery ISO image. You can access the image at a later stage for the purposes of booting the instances, so that you can then create your cluster.

//This procedure needs enhancing. It's not very clear to me. This is also the stage where they create buckets etc.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for provisioning {oci} resources are provided as an example only. You can also choose to create the required resources through other methods; the scripts are just an example. 

Installing a cluster with infrastructure that you provide requires knowledge of the cloud provider and the installation process on {product-title}. You can access {oci} Resource Manager configurations to complete these steps, or use the configurations to model your own custom script. 
====

//We also have a defect on this - HCIDOCS-469. It's basically that the second sentence needs removing from here and adding as an actual procedure.

.Prerequisites

* You configured an {oci} account to host the cluster. See link:https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/openshift-on-oci/install-prereq.htm[Prerequisites (Oracle documentation)].

.Procedure

. Log in to your link:https://cloud.oracle.com/a/[{oci-first-no-rt}] account with administrator privileges.

. Download an archive file from an Oracle resource. The archive file includes files for creating cluster resources and custom manifests. The archive file also includes a script, and when you run the script, the script creates {oci} resources, such as DNS records, an instance, and so on. For more information, see link:https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/openshift-on-oci/install-prereq.htm#install-configuration-files[Configuration Files (Oracle documentation)].
