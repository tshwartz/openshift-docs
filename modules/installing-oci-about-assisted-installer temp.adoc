= The {ai-full} and {oci} overview

You can run cluster workloads on {oci-first} infrastructure that supports dedicated, hybrid, public, and multiple cloud environments. Both Red{nbsp}Hat and Oracle test, validate, and support running {oci} in an {product-title} cluster on {oci}.

.About the (ai-full)

The {ai-full} is a tool designed to automate the installation and management of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. 

If you are unfamiliar with the {product-title} {ai-full}, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/installing_openshift_container_platform_with_the_assisted_installer/index[{ai-full} for {product-title}].

.About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform offered by Oracle Corporation, designed to provide services that can meet your needs for regulatory compliance, performance, and cost-effectiveness. You can use the {ai-full} to install an {product-title} cluster on the {oci} platform, deploying cloud-native components such as OCI Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) and Oracleâ€™s Container Storage Interface (CSI), and integrating your cluster with OCI API resources such as instance node, load balancer, and storage.

.Deployment options

The integration between OCP and OCI is certified on both virtual machines (BMs) and bare metal (BM) machines. Bare metal installations using iSCSI boot drives require a secondary vNIC. Oracle provide the secondary vNICs via custom manifests. There are two separate manifests, one for compute nodes defined as bare metal instances and one for control plane nodes defined as bare metal instances.

.Performance considerations

To ensure the best performance conditions for your cluster workloads that operate on {oci}, ensure that volume performance units (VPUs) for your block volume are sized for your workloads. The following list provides guidance for selecting the VPUs needed for specific performance needs:

* Test or proof of concept environment: 100 GB, and 20 to 30 VPUs.
* Basic environment: 500 GB, and 60 VPUs.
* Heavy production environment: More than 500 GB, and 100 or more VPUs.

Consider reserving additional VPUs to provide sufficient capacity for updates and scaling activities. For more information about VPUs, see Volume Performance Units (Oracle documentation).

.Workflow 

The workflow for using the {ai-full} in a connected environment to install a cluster on {oci} is displayed in the diagram and summarized below.

. In the {oci} console, create a stack for the OCI resources and save it locally as a ZIP file:

.. TBD

.. TBD

. In the {ai} console, set up a cluster:

.. Create the cluster.

.. Generate and download the discovery ISO image.

. In the {oci} console, create the infrastructure:

.. Create a new bucket or use a default bucket provided by {oci}.

.. Upload the discovery ISO image to the bucket.

.. Upload the stack file stored locally and use it to create the stack.

.. Update the manifests with the secret.

. In the {ai} console, complete the cluster installation:

.. Set roles for the cluster nodes.

.. Upload the manifests provided by Oracle.

.. Install the cluster.
