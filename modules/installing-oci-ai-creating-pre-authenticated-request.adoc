= Creating a pre-authenticated request in the {oci} web console

You now create a pre-authenticated request for your uploaded discovery ISO image. 

Ensure that you make note of the URL from the pre-authenticated request, because you must specify this URL at a later stage when you create an {oci} stack.

For more information about pre-authenticated requests, see link:https://docs.public.oneportal.content.oci.oraclecloud.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm[Object Storage Pre-Authenticated Requests]
