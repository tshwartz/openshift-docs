== Finding the Driver Toolkit image URL in the payload

.Prerequisites

* You obtained the image {cluster-manager-url-pull}.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. The image URL of the `driver-toolkit` corresponding to a certain release can be extracted from the release image using the `oc adm` command:
+
--
* For an x86 image, the command is as follows:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release info quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:{product-version}.z-x86_64 --image-for=driver-toolkit
----

* For an ARM image, the command is as follows:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release info quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:{product-version}.z-aarch64 --image-for=driver-toolkit
----

.Example output

The output for the `ocp-release:4.11.0-x86_64` image is as follows:
