= Installing {product-title} with the Agent-based Installer

The following procedure deploys a single-node {product-title}. You can use this procedure as a basis and modify according to your requirements.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/latest [OpenShift mirror site] and download the latest version of the tarball that matches your operating system.

. Extract the binary by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar xvf <file> -C ~/.local/bin
----
+
The file contains the Agent-based Installer.

. Install `nmstate` dependency by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf install /usr/bin/nmstatectl -y
----

. Place the `openshift-install` binary in a directory that is on your PATH.

. Create a directory to store the cluster manifests by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir ~/<directory_name>
----

+
[NOTE]
====
This is the preferred method for the Agent-based installation. Using ZTP manifests is optional.
====

. Create the `install-config.yaml` file:

<1> This IP address is used to determine which node performs the bootstrapping process as well as running the `assisted-service` component.
You must provide the IP address when you do not specify the node's IP addresses in the `networkConfig` parameter. If this address is not provided, one IP address is selected from the provided nodes's `networkConfig`.
You must provide the IP address when you do not specify the node's IP addresses in the `networkConfig` parameter. If this address is not provided, one IP address is selected from the provided nodes's `networkConfig`.
<2> The number of hosts defined must match the total number of hosts defined in the `install-config.yaml` file, which is the sum of the values of the `compute.replicas` and `controlPlane.replicas` parameters. When 3 master nodes and 0 worker nodes are defined in the `install-config.yaml` file,
the number of hosts defined is 3. When 3 master nodes and 2 worker nodes are defined in the `install-config.yaml` file, the number of hosts defined is 5.

. Create the Agent image by running the following command:
+
[NOTE]
====
Ensure that the image is created in the same path as the **auth** folder. You can verify this with the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ ls
agent.iso  auth
----
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install agent create image
----

. Boot the `agent.iso` image on the bare metal machines. You can run the image on any Linux distribution.

. To track the progress and verify sucessful installation, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install agent wait-for install-complete
