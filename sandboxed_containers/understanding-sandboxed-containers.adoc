{sandboxed-containers-first} support for {product-title} provides you with built-in support for running Kata Containers as an additional optional runtime. The new runtime supports containers in dedicated virtual machines (VMs), providing improved workload isolation. This is particularly useful for performing the following tasks:

Run privileged or untrusted workloads:: {sandboxed-containers-first} (OSC) makes it possible to safely run workloads that require specific privileges, without having to risk compromising cluster nodes by running privileged containers. Workloads that require special privileges include the following:
* Workloads that require special capabilities from the kernel, beyond the default ones granted by standard container runtimes such as CRI-O, for example to access low-level networking features.
* Workloads that need elevated root privileges, for example to access a specific physical device. With {sandboxed-containers-first}, it is possible to pass only a specific device through to the VM, ensuring that the workload cannot access or misconfigure the rest of the system.
* Workloads for installing or using `set-uid` root binaries. These binaries grant special privileges and, as such, can present a security risk. With {sandboxed-containers-first}, additional privileges are restricted to the virtual machines, and grant no special access to the cluster nodes.

Some workloads may require privileges specifically for configuring the cluster nodes. Such workloads should still use privileged containers, because running on a virtual machine would prevent them from functioning.

Ensure kernel isolation for each workload:: {sandboxed-containers-first} supports workloads that require custom kernel tuning (such as `sysctl`, scheduler changes, or cache tuning) and the creation of custom kernel modules (such as `out of tree` or special arguments).

Share the same workload across tenants:: {sandboxed-containers-first} enables you to support multiple users (tenants) from different organizations sharing the same OpenShift cluster. The system also lets you run third-party workloads from multiple vendors, such as container network functions (CNFs) and enterprise applications. Third-party CNFs, for example, may not want their custom settings interfering with packet tuning or with `sysctl` variables set by other applications. Running inside a completely isolated kernel is helpful in preventing "noisy neighbor" configuration problems.

Ensure proper isolation and sandboxing for testing software:: You can use {sandboxed-containers-first} to run a containerized workload with known vulnerabilities or to handle an issue in a legacy application.  This isolation also enables administrators to give developers administrative control over pods, which is useful when the developer wants to test or validate configurations beyond those an administrator would typically grant. Administrators can, for example, safely and securely delegate kernel packet filtering (eBPF) to developers. Kernel packet filtering requires `CAP_ADMIN` or `CAP_BPF` privileges, and is therefore not allowed under a standard CRI-O configuration, as this would grant access to every process on the Container Host worker node. Similarly, administrators can grant access to intrusive tools such as SystemTap, or support the loading of custom kernel modules during their development.

Ensure default resource containment through VM boundaries:: By default, resources such as CPU, memory, storage, or networking are managed in a more robust and secure way in {sandboxed-containers-first}. Since {sandboxed-containers-first} are deployed on VMs, additional layers of isolation and security give a finer-grained access control to the resource. For example, an errant container will not be able to allocate more memory than is available to the VM. Conversely, a container that needs dedicated access to a network card or to a disk can take complete control over that device without getting any access to other devices.
