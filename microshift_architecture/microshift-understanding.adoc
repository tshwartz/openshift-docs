== About MicroShift

MicroShift is a distribution of {OCP} optimized for small form factor and edge computing.

Edge devices deployed in the field pose very different operational, environmental, and business challenges from those of cloud computing. These challenges motivate different engineering trade-offs for Kubernetes at the far edge than for cloud or near-edge scenarios. MicroShift's design goals cater to this:

* Make frugal use of system resources, such as CPU, memory, network, and storage
* Tolerate severe networking constraints
* Update securely, safely, quickly, and seamlessly, without disrupting workloads
* Extend and integrate cleanly with edge-optimized operating systems, like Fedora IoT and {op-system-first}
* Provide a consistent development and management experience with other distributions of {OCP}
